# actionmap-remap
Usage: Windows will reorder USB devices sometime and then Star Citzen will no longer have the correct button maps.
This takes an existing working actionmaps.xml (You should always be manually backing up this file anytime you change your binds)
\Roberts Space Industries\StarCitizen\(PTU or LIVE)\USER\Client\0\Profiles\default\actionmaps.xml
Then after Windows changes the device order or if you have to delete Star Citizen USER directory this will help get back the old binds
